# vagrant-ks8-env
Creating a Kubernetes environment using Vagrant along with Virtualbox

<p>This repository provides a template Vagrantfile to create a Kubernetes cluster with a Master Node and N Worker Nodes, using the VirtualBox hypervisor on your local machine.</p>

### <h2>Setup</h2>

### Dependencies
<p>Before running the startup script, it is required that you install, on your local machine, the Vagrant and Virtualbox software. </p>

* [VirtualBox][virtualbox] 4.3.10 or greater.
* [Vagrant][vagrant] 1.6 or greater.


### Cloning the project from Github
```
git clone https://github.com/bmartinezm/vagrant-ks8-env.git
```

### Configuration
The following table lists the configurable parameters of the [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile) and their default values.

</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>vm_gui</code></td>
<td>If this value is set to true, all CentOS VMs will include the GUI software</td>
<td><code>false</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>vm_size</code></td>
<td>It is the assigned Memory and CPU per instance.Be aware that the minimum memory and CPU per instance is  4096 MB and 2 vcpus</td>
<td><code>{"cpus" => 2, "memory" => 2048}</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>vm_name_mn</code></td>

<td><code>"192.168.100."</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>

### Startup 
<p>A Bash script was created to startup easily the Vagrant project. Before running it, make sure that all software and hardware requirements are met.</p>

```
cd vagrant-ks8-env
./startup.sh
```

### <h2>SSH Access</h2>
<p>The startup.sh script triggers the "vagrant up" command to pull the CentOS images (boxes), create the VMs, and download all necessary software to create a Kubernetes cluster. It also creates a ssh key pair to ssh the master and worker nodes. </p>

<h3>Master Node</h3>

```
ssh -i ssh-key vagrant@<vm_net_ip>.10
```
<h3>Worker Nodes</h3>

```
ssh -i ssh-key vagrant@<vm_net_ip>.1N
```

<p>Where N is the number of worker nodes. <b>If you do not change the default network configuration, you could access the servers as follow.</b></p>

<h3>Master node - Defaul net configuration</h3>

```
ssh -i ssh-key vagrant@192.168.100.10
```

<h3>Worker nodes - Defaul net configuration</h3>

```
ssh -i ssh-key vagrant@192.168.100.11
ssh -i ssh-key vagrant@192.168.100.12
ssh -i ssh-key vagrant@192.168.100.1N
```
